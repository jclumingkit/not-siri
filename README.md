This is a web challenge from [here](https://debonair-bowl-837.notion.site/Web-App-Challenge-10bd9b0e8a5f809db35ddb4161e7e81d). It is a very simple chatbot with the following features:

- Copy AI response
- Regenerate AI response
- Persist chat history in the browser
- Clear chat history

## Prerequisites

- A clone of this repository to your local machine.
- An OpenAI API key. You can get one [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

## Getting Started

#### 1: Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

#### 2: Create a `.env.local` file to the project root and add your OpenAI API key.

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

#### 3: Run your application

```bash
npm run dev
```
